**`SMART framework:`**

1. **Specific**: Understanding and analyzing the relationship between specific factors and life expectancy, as well as identifying significant trends and patterns from 2000 to 2015.

2. **Measurable**: Variables such as 'Life Expectancy,' 'Adult Mortality,' 'Alcohol,' 'HIV/AIDS,' and others will be thoroughly analyzed. Measurement metrics involve descriptive statistical calculations, correlation between variables, and graphical visualization to provide clear insights.

3. **Achievable**: Conducting analysis on data regarding life expectancy and other health factors to observe the relationships between variables.

4. **Relevant**: The analysis conducted will provide a deep understanding of changes over 15 years (2000-2015).

5. **Time-Bound**: Insights will be obtained after a week of initiating the analysis.

**`Problem statement:`**
The ultimate goal is to understand the factors that have the greatest impact (lifestyle patterns, diseases, mortality rates, etc.) on an individual's life expectancy. This can be achieved by analyzing and understanding all types of variables related to health factors and life expectancy through data spanning 15 years (2000-2015).

**`Objective:`**
To understand and analyze the relationship between specific factors and life expectancy, as well as identifying trends and significant patterns from 2000 to 2015.

**`Tools:`**
- Analysis: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
